## About The Project
Public configuration and definition of services to use DEMIS in a self-managed Kubernetes Cluster.

### Release Notes
See [ReleaseNotes](ReleaseNotes.md) for all information regarding the (newest) releases.

## Getting Started
To use this stage-project in your Kubernetes cluster, you can use the project [DEMIS-Development-Cluster](https://github.com/gematik/DEMIS-Development-Cluster). 
This project provides a complete setup of the DEMIS environment. To deploy the DEMIS cluster locally, you
can follow the description in the [README](https://github.com/gematik/DEMIS-Development-Cluster/blob/main/README.md) 
of the project. 

By following the instructions from project DEMIS-Development-Cluster, you will be able to set up a local Kubernetes cluster 
with all the necessary components and configurations to run DEMIS. Additionally the stage-public repository will be 
checked out automatically by the command
```
make local init-stage
```

### Helm-Charts/GitHub-Credentials
The Helm-Charts from the GitHub-Repository [DEMIS-Helm-Charts](https://github.com/gematik/DEMIS-Helm-Charts) are public. 
Therefore, you do not need any GitHub-Credentials to check out the repository.
But to avoid to ran into rate-limits of GitHub, you can set your GitHub-Credentials in the files
* demis/credentials.tfvars
* idm/credentials.tfvars
* mesh/credentials.tfvars

You can set your GitHub-Credentials in this section:
```
#helm_repository_username = "USERNAME_HERE"
#helm_repository_password = "PASSWORD_HERE"
```

### DockerHub-Credentials
The DEMIS-Images from "docker.io/gematik1" are public and can be used without any credentials.
But to avoid to ran into rate limits of DockerHub, you can set your Credentials in the files:
* demis/credentials.tfvars
* idm/credentials.tfvars

You can set your user_name, user_email and user_password in this section:
```
# docker_pull_secrets = [
#   {
#     name          = "dockerhub-pull-secret"
#     registry      = "docker.io/gematik1"
#     user_name     = ""
#     user_email    = "my-mail@gematik.de"
#     user_password = "" # DockerHub-Access Token
#     password_type = "plain"
#   }
# ]
```
